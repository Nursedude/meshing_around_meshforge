"""README structural-count drift guard (2026-07-23 doc audit).

The README hardcodes filesystem-derived counts (test files, handler modules)
inside `<!--STAT:*-->` sentinels. `scripts/readme_stats.py` is their SSOT.
This test runs its `--check` so the CI run the repo already performs fails the
moment a sentinel drifts from the tree — the same "regenerate, never trust a
carried-forward number" discipline the code linter enforces, applied to docs.

These counts are pure filesystem globs, so they are identical in CI and on a
dev box (unlike the total test count, which depends on installed optional deps
and is therefore stated qualitatively in the README, not gated).
